#### Overall Comments on the Method:

Artifacts can provide historical, demographic, and sometimes personal information that is unavailable from any other sources. Provides a solid background and introduction to data collection.

Artifacts are rich sources, written or visual sources of data, that contribute to our understanding of what is happening in our research world (e.g., classrooms, departments, institutions).

Documents can corroborate your observations and interviews and make your findings more trustworthy.

In addition to increasing validity, artifacts may also raise questions about your intuitions and then lead to shaping new directions for more data collection. New data leads in new directions. Staying focused and being flexible is a constant tension.

##### Types of Artifacts

Artifact/Archival Methods can be used to provide historical, demographic and personal information, and used to corroborate and challenge other data. Examples include:

*   Diaries, journals, letters, memos, graffiti, notes, scrapbooks, membership lists, institutional newsletters and newspapers, meeting minutes, attendance rates, retention rates, assessment scores, mission statements, computer accessed websites, syllabi
*   Maps, seating charts, films, videos, drawings, paintings, photographs, music
*   Student work (writing samples, tests)
*   Free response text (e.g., e-mail, blogs)

#### Preparation:

- It is important to think carefully and deeply about the research setting to come up with creative ideas about useful artifacts.

- It can be very helpful to brainstorm ideas with trusted &quot;members&quot; of the setting.

- There are many resources available. It&#39;s not always necessary to &quot;reinvent the wheel&quot; and collect totally original data.

- Be clear about (and document) what you are collecting and why. Check your ideas/choices with knowledgeable insiders.

- You can ask research participants to produce documents for you (keep diaries or journals, test scores, attendance records, etc.

#### Implementation:

- It is important to take good notes about the setting of the artifact, why it was chosen, what it is, etc.

- Sometimes you need to locate multiple artifacts that help corroborate each other (e.g. meeting minutes that reflect school policies, classroom photos that show environments that reflect the goals stated in a institution&#39;s mission statement).

- Some artifacts (e.g. student work examples, classroom photos, school motto) are embedded in a context that can be documented and used for interpretation. Sometimes, however, artifacts are limited in their uses because the researcher can&#39;t &quot;get behind&quot; them to learn more about the context from which they came (e.g. what are the characteristics of the people buying the higher education books that are on a best seller list?). In the latter instance, the researcher has to look for connections and/or dig deeper to gain information that will help provide the context necessary for interpretation.

#### Examples of Artifact/Archival Analysis from Master's Projects 

##### Example #1:

> What are the factors that influence faculty participation in sponsored scholarship at a non-"very high research activity" university and how can institutional support and policy promote scholarship productivity?

The archival analysis examined the online policies of 21 universities, specifically addressing three types of policies: faculty supplemental compensation, university indirect cost recovery allocation, and external consulting.  These three policies were selected as examples of how other universities structure their research efforts and incentivize their faculty to participate in scholarship.  Schools were selected based on a number of criteria including size, research capacity, reputation and scholarship tradition.  A variety of schools were chosen in an effort to present a range of institution types and to mark any difference in policy between highly active and non-highly active schools.  The schools chosen for analyses are outlined in Table 1 below.

##### Example #2:

> What are the differences in the reported levels of engagement and institutional satisfaction between veteran community college students who participate in veteran student organizations and those that do not?

##### Example #3:

> How does study abroad outside of Israel affect Jewish engagement in Jewish college students?

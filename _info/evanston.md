#### Evanston Attractions

Evanston has [five public beaches](http://www.cityofevanston.org/parks-recreation/lakefront-beaches/) (there is also a private beach on Northwesternâ€™s campus for NU students, faculty and staff only), so when the weather is warm Lake Michigan is a great place to cool off.

Dozens of major motion pictures have filmed scenes in Evanston, including Contagion (2011), starring Matt Damon; The Weather Man (2005), starring Nicholas Cage; and Road to Perdition (2002), starring Tom Hanks and Paul Newman.

Evanston is where several movie and TV stars were born or grew up, including Seth Meyers, Jeremy Piven, Zach Gilford, and John and Joan Cusack.

Evanston is one of several cities that claim to be the birthplace of the ice cream sundae. Whether or not that is accurate, there are lots of good [ice cream/gelato/frozen yogurt eateries](http://www.yelp.com/search?find_desc=Ice+cream&find_loc=Evanston%2C+IL&ns=1&ls=102a1a1cd725efa4#find_desc=Ice+cream+yogurt) in town!

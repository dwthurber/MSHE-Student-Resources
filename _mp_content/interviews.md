#### Characteristics of Good Interview Questions

Consider the following characteristics of good interview questions.

1.  Avoid closed-ended questions that are dichotomous (e.g., questions that can be answered simply “yes” or “no”). They provide little information and stifle discussion.
2.  Open-ended questions allow the respondent to determine the nature of the answer.
3.  Ask “what” instead of “why” unless there is a specific reason for asking why.
4.  Questions should be designed to determine how the respondent structures the world, not how the respondents respond to the researcher’s view of the world.
5.  Ask “balanced” questions. For example, if you ask what class a student likes best, at the same time, ask which class he/she liked least. Or “What are the pros and cons” of XXXX?”
6.  The way in which questions are worded may place respondents in embarrassing or defensive situations. For example, instead of asking respondents, “Why don’t you take your child in for a regular check-up with a doctor?” the same questions might be asked as “What prevents you from taking your child to the doctor as often as you would like?”
7.  Ask for concrete details, examples, stories.
8.  Ask direct questions about an event rather than asking respondents to “remember.” If you do ask a question about something in the past, develop your question in such a way as to bring the respondent back in the original environment. For example, you might ask, “For the next few minutes, think back to your freshman year and your favorite class. What was it about that class that you liked?”
9.  Questions should be phrased simply and in language that the respondent understands. Long, complex, multipart questions are not only difficult to understand; response is also difficult.

#### Interviewing Tips

##### Introduction

There is a skill to conducting good interviews. Below are some tips that might be helpful as you prepare.

##### Scheduling the Interview

Students are busy just like you. When setting up the interview, find a time when you and the students have at least one hour for this conversation. Try not to “fit in” the interview between two other scheduled meetings. If you do, everyone will be watching the time. Evenings generally work the best for undergraduate students--and probably you, too.

Consider carefully the location of your interview. Coffee shops, an empty classroom, your office--if you have one on campus--are probably the best. The more public the location, the less forthcoming the students may be.

##### Arrive a Little Early

It would be helpful if you would arrive at the interview location _at least_ 15 minutes before the interview is to begin. If students arrive at the location and don’t find anyone there, they are likely to leave.

##### Purposeful Small Talk

It is important to make the students feel comfortable right from the start. Small talk is essential just prior to the beginning of the interview. Plan your welcoming strategy in advance. If you are meeting in a coffee shop, offer to buy the administrator/student a cup of coffee.

##### The Interview Questions

The interview protocol sets the agenda for the

interview. The actual questions (i.e., the way they are worded) and the sequence of questions are important. Hopefully your questions have been ordered from the more general to the more specific and by their relative importance to the theory/ theories you are exploring.

Although it is important to stick to your interview protocol, interviewers also need to be flexible. If the student answers one of the questions farther down on the interview protocol, “go with the flow.” But in general, we recommend resisting the impulse to reword the questions or to change the order of them.

Also, prior to the actual interview, you should be familiar enough with the questions and the sequence of questions that you do not have to constantly refer to a sheet of paper.

##### Beginning the Interview

The first few minutes of an interview are

critical. In a brief time, the interviewer must create a thoughtful, permissive atmosphere; provide the ground rules; and set the tone of the discussion. Much of the success of interview can be attributed to the development of this open environment.

Here is an example of a typical introduction, but it important that the interviewer be him/ herself. Don’t just read this.

>_Thank you for taking the time to share your experiences as an undergraduate tonight. My name is Gertrude Graduate Student. I am a graduate students in the master’s of higher education program in SESP. I’m conducting two interviews as a part of my final paper for a course called, The College Student. In this class we’ve been studying how students change during college._
>
>_Tonight I’ll be asking you a number of questions about your undergraduate college experience. There are no right or wrong answers. I hope you will feel comfortable talking frankly and honestly._
>
>_This is strictly a interview for my final paper in The College Student. Your answers will in no way affect your academic standing at Northwestern. In fact, we’re on first name basis tonight, and in my final paper I won’t be using your name. While I hope you will feel free to share your thoughts, you do not have to answer any questions that you do not want to._
>
>_I’d like to tape record this interview just so that I can capture as many of your comments as possible. When I write the final report I may use some of your exact quotes, but I will not identify you in any way. In order to ensure that we have your permission to tape record this interview, I ask that you review the information on the Informed Consent form and sign the form before we begin._

[Give students a few minutes to sign the Informed Consent form and then collect it.]

>_The interview will last about an hour. Do you have any questions?_
>
>_Well, let’s begin._

The first question should be one that “breaks the ice” and puts the students at ease.

##### Stick to the Questions

Ask the first interview question, being careful to reflect back what you think the student has said.

Don’t go much beyond the interview questions. Don’t offer your opinion, no matter how tempting. It is important that the interviewer not “lead” the students in the sense of providing an answer. Rephrasing a question can be helpful, but suggesting what the student should say is not what the interview is designed to do. Finally, don’t allow the student to stay too long on one question.

##### Two Essential Techniques: **The Pause** and **The Probe**

Interviewers should be familiar with two essential techniques: the five-second pause and the probe. Both techniques are easy to use and helpful in soliciting additional information from students.

**The Pause**

The five-second pause is most often used after a student comment. This sort pause often prompts more conversation. There is a tendency for novice interviewers to talk too much, to dominate the discussion with questions and to move too quickly from one topic to another. Often, the short pause will elicit additional points of view, especially when coupled with eye contact from the interviewer.

**The Probe**

The second essential technique is the probe, the request for additional information. In most conversations and there is a tendency for people to make vague comments that could have multiple meanings. When this occurs, the probe is an effective technique to elicit additional information. Typical, probing involves such comments as

_“Would you explain further?” “Would you give me an example of what you mean?” “Would you say more?” “Is there anything else?” “Please describe what you mean.”_

_“I don’t understand.”_

_“Tell me more.”_

_“Does you have an example of that?”_

_“What experiences have you had that make you feel that way?”_

It is usually best to use the probe early in the interview to communicate the importance of precision in responses and then use it sparingly in later discussion.

##### Responding to Student Comments

The interviewer should avoid head nodding. It can signal agreement and, as a result, elicit additional comments of the same type. In addition, interviewers should avoid providing short verbal responses that signal approval or acceptance. Examples include: _“correct, that’s good,”_ or _“excellent.”_ Instead, use more neutral responses such as, _“yes, OK,”_ or _“uh huh.”_

##### Concluding the Interview

Thank the interviewee. If you feel like it, the interviewer can try to summarize the conversation and then ask if he/she has additional thoughts. Or ask, _“Is there anything missing from our conversation?_” or _“Is there anything else you think I should know?”_

##### Have Fun

Interviews with students or administrators are fun and usually very rewarding.

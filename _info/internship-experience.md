title: Internship Experience
description: 'There are many different routes a student can take in finding a rewarding internship. Some students start their internship immediately upon entering the program. Others prefer to take a few classes first and research areas of interest before beginning an internship. Doing multiple internships is also a great way to experience different higher education roles and departments to find the best professional fit, while doing a longer-term internship (3 quarters or more) allows students to get in-depth experience and take on a high level of responsibility.'

<br>**Finding an Internship**
<br>Some students begin the process of looking for an internship months before they begin taking courses in the program. For example, early decision admittees often begin interviewing for internships for the coming year in March during Preview Northwestern Days. Other students decide not to start their internship until after they have taken some courses, so their search process may start much later. In general, admitted students should contact Lois Trautvetter at l-trautvetter@northwestern.edu at least one quarter prior to the quarter in which they want to intern and schedule a time to meet to discuss areas of interest and career goals. In addition, the program uses the internship preferences that you provided on your application to guide the placement process.

<br>Throughout the year, Higher Education staff e-mail internship postings to students through the Master of Science in Higher Education Administration and Policy listserv. Instructions on how to pursue a particular internship and supervisor contact information are included in the internship posting. Often students are asked to send a resume along with a cover letter e-mail to the contact person. The contact person then follows up with a request for an interview.

<br>The internship search, like any job search, can take some time and effort. The Higher Education Administration and Policy faculty and staff are here to help and guide you through the process. University Career Services, along with your personal contacts, can also be useful sources of information, providing internship listings and advice.

<br>Remember to keep the Master of Science in Higher Education Administration and Policy office in the loop about your internship search process. If you are interested in an internship posting contact Lois Trautvetter before you apply to the position or copy her on your e-mail requesting an interview.

<br>Though there are sometimes cases where we encourage students to reach out to new departments/organizations about a possible internship, keep in mind that the Master of Science in Higher Education Administration and Policy program has established relationships with many people and institutions, and they can leverage those relationships to help students find internships. There may be an internship opportunity that is available but has not been on the listserv. It is important to let Lois know of your interests in order to assist you in finding an appropriate internship, especially if your interests have changed.

<br>**Interview Preparation**

<br>Generally, internship interviews are less formal than job interviews, but it is still important to be prepared. Most often the internship supervisor will already have been sent a copy of your resume, however it is a good idea to bring a copy with you as well.

<br>You should already be familiar with the internship description. Take some time to research the department through its website or other materials to familiarize yourself with their mission and operations. Reflect on your professional interests, strengths and weaknesses and think about what experiences you want to get out of the internship. Keep in mind that even if an internship isn’t in the exact area of your interest it may have transferrable skills.

<br>During the interview, listen to the questions that the employer is asking. Structure your answers so that it is easy for the interviewer to relate the answers to the internship and understand why you would be a good fit for that particular department. Be ready to ask thoughtful questions at the end of the interview based on your research.

<br>Students may interview with a number of employers before finding the right internship. It is about making the right match. It’s always a good idea to send thank you notes after each interview. Besides being the polite thing to do, nicely written thank you notes help applicants stand out among other interviewees and even if one position does not work out, employers will remember the professional kindness when hiring for other roles.

<br>In some cases, students will be directly notified by the departments that are hiring that they have been selected. Please let Lois Trautvetter know that you have been notified and if you have taken the offer or not. Please do not turn down an offer until discussing the matter with your academic advisor or the Program Director. In other cases, someone in the Master of Science in Higher Education Administration and Policy Office will contact you that you have been offered a position. Please feel free to discuss your offers with the Program Director or your advisor at any time.

<br>**Before Starting an Internship**

<br>Once you have accepted an internship offer, you will work with your supervisor to complete an Internship Contract (available at the end of this handbook). The Internship Contract outlines the terms of the internship, the duties to be performed by the intern and the objectives that the internship is designed to meet. This form allows our office to know where our students are interning and keep track of what internships are available.

<br>Return the Internship Contract to the Master of Science in Higher Education Administration and Policy Program Director, Lois Trautvetter. The Director must approve this contract before the student begins the internship. It is the responsibility of the student (not the internship supervisor) to send the form to Lois Trautvetter.

<br>Once you’ve turned in the Internship Contract you will be added to the Internship course Canvas site. This site contains useful resources, including information about how to compile the internship portfolio and reflective paper that you will turn in for academic credit. If you are in an internship, but do not have access to the Internship Canvas site please contact the Master of Science in Higher Education Administration and Policy office.
<br>Students must register for the internship course (MS_HE 485) through CAESAR if they wish to acquire credit for the experience. Unlike other courses, having access to the Canvas site does not mean that you’ve registered for the course. You will need a permission number to register for MS_HE 485. Contact your academic advisor to obtain the permission number.

<br>While it is convenient if the internship timeline corresponds to the 10 weeks of a quarter, it is not necessary. Prior to beginning the internship, students simply need to consult with their academic advisor and determine the quarter in which to register for the internship.

<br>**During the Internship**

<br>Ideally, interns and supervisors should plan to meet on a regular basis, at least once a week, throughout the internship. Ongoing feedback from the supervisor or other staff in the department and reflection on the student’s role ensure that everyone’s expectations of the experience are met. Show initiative and look for ways to help your supervisor and improve the department. Proactively seek projects that could help your supervisor, but other employees don’t have time to accomplish.

<br>Remember that your internship supervisor and others in the department can be powerful professional allies, so make sure that you are behaving professionally and giving the internship its due attention. We realize that Master of Science in Higher Education Administration and Policy students have a lot to juggle between coursework, an internship, and other personal and family obligations. It is important to remember, however, that you are viewed as an important member of the staff in your internship. Do your best to manage your time so that you can meet your internship supervisor’s expectations. Try to avoid asking for time off to complete class work, especially on short notice.

<br>Once you’ve established a rapport with your supervisor and others in the office, seek their advice about professional development, including professional organizations you may want to join, articles you should read or other skills or knowledge you should gain to best prepare you for a career in that area. Approach people within and outside of your department for informational interviews. They are a great, low-pressure way to broaden your professional network and learn about different facets of higher education.

<br>If you have a problem arise during your internship that you feel you cannot handle on your own, please do not hesitate to contact the Program Director.
<br>Check out the section on Academic Credit for more information on how to receive credit for an internship.&nbsp;

<br>**After the Internship**

<br>Have a final conversation with your supervisor to re-cap the internship experience and get feedback about your strengths and weaknesses. Keep a copy of the Evaluation Form (Links to an external site.) because this will be helpful to reflect on before job interviews.

<br>You may also want to follow-up with your academic advisor, career advisor, faculty members, and peers about your internship experiences.
<br>Be sure to thank your supervisor for the help and guidance they have provided during the internship. While not required, interns typically like to ask supervisors whether they would be willing to serve as a reference or write a recommendation letter. These can be helpful in the job search or in applications to doctoral programs.

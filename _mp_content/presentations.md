#### Presentation Formatting

Presentations will be happening in two rooms. Regardless of the room you present in, you should set up your presentation in widescreen format (16:9).

#### What to Include on your Presentation

1.  **Research Question:** Research question and terms should be well defined. Why is the question important to your professional development and/or to a wider audience?
2.  **Data Collection Methods:** Triangulation of methods/and or sources and how many respondents should be specified.
3.  **Data:** High quality evidence should be reduced and displayed in a comprehensive way.
4.  **Interpretation:** A compelling, unbiased interpretation of the data should be provided.
5.  **Conclusions:** The presentation should summarize the project and tie it abck to the research question. Also leave the audience with a good sense f what new research questions or next steps might be suggested by the project work.

For more details on what to include, please [read the presentation rubric](https://canvas.northwestern.edu/courses/37728/pages/mp-outline-and-rubrics)

#### Making your Presentation Look Good

There are many resources available for how to design presentations for free online. How you design your presentation will depend a lot on your personal style and preferences as well as your research project and the data/conclusions you have. That said, the following tips are some basic guidelines that are a good rule of thumb in most situations (adapted from ["How to make an effective PowerPoint presentation"](http://www.speakingaboutpresenting.com/design/powerpoint-design-recommended-tips/) by Olivia Mitchell):

1.  **Plan your content first**
The most important recommendation is to plan your content first. A number of experts all agree that taking time to craft a presentation before laying out content, makes for a better presentation overall. The content should drive design.
2.  **Use a plain background and remove any unecessary detail**
There is research that shows that any material (pictures, sounds or information ) which is not conceptually relevant to the topic harms learning. In other words, be careful about what template you use, if any. These templates come from the mindset that PowerPoint slides are like documents and so should be branded. Templates can add clutter and distract from the visual impact of a slide.
3.  **One idea per slide**
Use each slide to express one idea. Think about the slide from your veiwer's perspective. If a slide has too much text or tries to include too much information, then it will get your point across much better. Some research has also suggested that ideas are best presented as a full sentence rather than bullets.
4.  **Support the headline with graphic evidence**
Instead of bullets, support your points with graphic evidence. This can include photos, images, charts and diagrams. Richard Mayer calls this the Multimedia Principle: Use words and graphics rather than words alone. Richard Mayer looks at the results of ten different studies comparing the performance of students who learned from words plus graphics, or words alone and found that in all cases, students who received both words and graphics performed better on a subsequent transfer test.
5.  **Choose your graphics carefully**
While graphics might help, bad graphics can hurt more. Make sure your graphics are related to what is on the slide, are easy to connect to the concept on a glance, and are not so clever or interesting to distract from what you are saying.
6.  **You don’t always need a slide**
Remember that your slides go hand in hand with your presentation. Experts often suggest to only have a slide when they serve or enhance the presentation; not just to list what is being said.
7.  **Simplicity matters**
Many people may have heard of the 10/20/30 rule which states simply that presentations should be 10 slides, 20 minutes, and have text no less than 30 point font. This is a good rule of thumb in the corporate world, but doesn't always apply literally for research and education presentation. However, the core idea still matters. Keep presentations short, simple, and don't include too much text.

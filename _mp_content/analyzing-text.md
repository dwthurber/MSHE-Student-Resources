#### Wordle ([www.wordle.com](www.wordle.com))

Wordle is a fun (though non-scientific) way to analyze themes in text. Wordle will generate an image of words where the most frequently used words are larger.

To use wordle, follow these directions:

1.  Click on the **create** tab at the top.
2.  Paste in text from interview transcripts, your lit review or any other text you’d like to “analyze” and hit **go**.
    *   **Note:** You will need to have (or download) a Java plugin. Mac users may encounter an issue with viewing the Wordle but this issue can be resolved. See trouble shooting tips at [http://www.wordle.net/faq#redx](http://www.wordle.net/faq#redx).
3.  The Wordle will be generated in a random format which you can then modify.

    answer: 'We hope everyone can get as much out of the MSHE MeetUp program as possible, and we do our best to match as many alumni who sign up with students as possible. However, in the past, we have had more alumni sign up than current students and so not every alumna/us has gotten a student match every quarter. The MSHE office makes matches based on the information provided in the interest forms for both the Alumna/us and Student.'
    students: false
    alumni: true
  - question: Can I request a change in my match if I am not happy with it?

While we cannot guarantee a perfect fit, we hope the opportunity to participate in multiple Meet-Ups throughout your MSHE career will enable you to meet your learning objectives. All this said, you are always welcome to express your feelings about your match to Audra Nelson.'

    <div class="container editable"><h3>Why MeetUp?</h3><p>MSHE MeetUps are like informational interviews. Students will share their background and goals in advance, and come to the conversation with a clear learning objective. They will also share the latest MSHE developments. From the students' perspective, the purpose of the MeetUp is to learn&mdash;not to seek a job from alumni. Alumni, on the other hand, enjoy sharing their insights and reconnecting with the program in a meaningful way.</p><p>The engagement allows students and alumni to expand their networks by meeting someone with similar interests. Although the expectation is for only a single meeting, the relationship can be developed if both participants choose.</p></div>

#### Virtual Orientation

Virtual Orientation can be found on the [MSHE Canvas Course](https://canvas.northwestern.edu/courses/9210). You are invited to the course after being accepted into the program and must be completed online before you begin classes. The canvas course and materials are available to you for the duration of your first quarter in the program for your reference. Please contact [ms-highered@northwestern.edu](javascript:void(location.href='mailto:'+String.fromCharCode(109,115,45,104,105,103,104,101,114,101,100,64,110,111,114,116,104,119,101,115,116,101,114,110,46,101,100,117))) if you want access to orientation materials after you are not longer a participant in the online course.&nbsp;

#### On-Campus Orientation

On-campus orientation takes place right before the start of fall quarter each year on the Evanston campus of Northwestern University. The orientation typically takes place in the evening. Since it is a great way to get to know fellow classmates and get involved in the program's community, it is required for all students to attend this orientation if at all possible, even if they have started the program in a previous quarter and have been taking classes prior to the orientation date.&nbsp;

Details about the orientation are sent out by email prior to the orientation.&nbsp;

#### Internship Orientation

Internship orientation typically takes place right before on-campus orientation in person on the Evanston campus of Northwestern University. Internship orientation is required for all students who are completing an internship or plan to complete an internship while in the program.&nbsp;

Details about the internship orientation are sent out by email prior to the internship orientation.

#### International Student Orientation

International graduate students are required to attend one of three information sessions and may [register here](http://www.northwestern.edu/international/living-working/before-arrival/student-orientation-and-check-in/graduate-international-student-orientation.html). Students will have the opportunity to tour campus, meet with representatives from banks and cellular companies to set up accounts, and hear from the international office about other resources.&nbsp;

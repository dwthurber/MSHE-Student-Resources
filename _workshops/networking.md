## About {{ page.title }}

Networking is sharing purposeful information about yourself: experiences, accomplishments, and career interests. It's developing mutually beneﬁcial relationships to exchange information, ideas, support, and resources. And it's a powerful strategy to seek employment and to tap into the hidden job market. For example, 50-75% of Northwestern students report ﬁnding their jobs/internships through networking on annual graduation surveys and 29% of recent graduates reported that they wish they had spent more time networking while in college.

#### Your Student Account

You can access your student account, track your tuition payments, view and pay outstanding charges and view and accept student loans in [CAESAR](http://www.northwestern.edu/caesar/).

#### Office of Student Accounts

The Office of Student Accounts and Student Financial Services are separate offices. In general, Student Financial Services creates student loan packages and answers questions about student loans. Student Accounts ensures that scholarships are posted to your account and answers questions about tuition bills. It can be confusing to know which office to contact for different questions. If you aren't sure, [Colleen Delaney](mailto:c-delaney@northwestern.edu) in Student Financial Services is a good person to start with. You can also contact your academic advisor. You can reach the Office of Student Accounts at [studentaccounts-ev@northwestern.edu.](mailto:studentaccounts-ev@northwestern.edu)

#### Tuition Bills

Tuition bills are posted electronically to [CAESAR](http://www.northwestern.edu/caesar/). Students will receive an email at their Northwestern email address when a tuition bill is posted.

The [Student Financial Services website](http://www.northwestern.edu/sfs/) has a chart showing when tuition is billed and when payments are due each quarter. Students have to pay the full balance of their tuition bill by the payment deadline. If they do not a late fee of $150 can be assessed on the next monthly billing cycle. Full-time students can sign up for the 9-pay program, which spreads payments out monthly, but part-time students do not have access to this service.

That said, it is not uncommon for students to register for courses after the quarterly payment deadline. Student tuition bills are processed on the 10th of each month, so if you haven't registered by the 10th you will be billed the following month.

#### Overdue Payments

Overdue payments will result in a late fee and a hold on your ability to register for classes or obtain an official transcript. If you received a late charge that you feel should be reversed contact Student Accounts and also copy your MSHE academic advisor. For all other questions related to student finances please see call Student Financial Services or visit their website.

#### Tax Documents (1098T)

Each year students and recent graduates will get a tax document called the 1098T showing how much tuition they paid. You can access the document by going to [CAESAR](http://www.northwestern.edu/caesar/) > Student Center > 1098-T. If you have questions about this document or cannot access the document contact Contact Student Accounts at 847-491-5224 or [studentaccounts-ev@northwestern.edu](mailto:studentaccounts-ev@northwestern.edu).

#### NU Employee Tuition Benefit

Full-time Northwestern University employees are entitled 75% off graduate tuition up to $10,000 each year. Employees must fill out an application for the benefit each calendar year. More details and the application are available on the [Human Resources website](http://www.northwestern.edu/hr/benefits/educational-assistance/benefits.html).

#### Categories of Survey Research

DESCRIPTION

*   How much time do students spend studying each week?
*   What is the average amount of debt our students have at graduation?
*   What are the most widely used career counseling techniques?
*   What are the satisfaction levels of African American seniors?

EXPLORATION/PREDICTION

*   Do students with tenured faculty instructors earn higher grades in class?
*   What is the relationship between college choice (1st, 2nd) and student satisfaction levels?
*   Do students affiliated with greek organizations give more money as alumni?

EXPLANATION/UNDERSTANDING

*   Why do female MBA students raise their hand in class less than their male counterparts?
*   Why do first generation college students have longer time-to-degree?
*   Why do first generation college students drop out of their PhD programs after year 6?

What is the point of administering a survey that can’t be accomplished in any other way?

*   Usually surveys are used to test a larger population (e.g., beyond your classroom)
*   May have already done some research in the form of fields notes, artifacts, interviews, focus groups and literature review and a survey would provide additional data to these types of data or follow-up with a larger group
*   Sometimes a pilot survey is used to frame an interview or focus group.
*   Examples of useful surveys: evaluation questionnaire, survey of knowledge content, survey of attitudes, survey of behaviors

#### Survey Concepts

##### Operationalize

*   Define something (variable, term, construct) in terms of a process needed to determine its existence, duration, quantity.
*   An indicator of the concept attribute within the concept
*   Concepts to variables to indicators

##### Levels of Measurement

*   Nominal (categorical)
*   Ordinal (rank order, but no distance)
*   Interval (scale, distance is meaningful)
*   Ratio (order, spacing, absolute zero)

##### Reliability and Validity

*   Reliability – consistency
*   Validity – accuracy in capturing true meaning
*   Interval (scale, distance is meaningful)
*   Ratio (order, spacing, absolute zero)

#### Qualities of a Good Question

*   Relevant 
*   Evokes the truth
*   Asks for an answer on only one dimension
*   Can accommodate all possible answers
*   Has mutually exclusive options 
*   Produces variability in responses
*   Follows comfortably from the previous question (order)

#### Thinking About Preparation:

1.  Accompany a survey with a brief introduction as to its purpose
2.  Address issues of anonymity or confidentiality. Decide whether to use respondents’ names or numbers.
3.  Need well-written questions
4.  Use multiple question types so survey can be interesting, but it is important to guard against creating a chaotic looking instrument.
5.  Attitude Scales (Likert – SA, A, U, D, SD and Semantic differentials—Boring vs. Exciting). Always use same order throughout.
6.  Decide when a forced choice item is appropriate (include yes/no, Likert scale questions, and others where the answer options are provided). Open-ended items provide different data from forced choice. If you use them you need to decide what you will do with unexpected responses.
7.  Think about the format of the survey (e.g., check vs. circling the responses).
8.  Use Contingency and matrix questions when appropriate.
9.  The order, logic, and formatting of the questions should make sense to the respondent. The order of the questions can affect the responses. Be sure the initial questions are interesting, but not too sensitive or affect later responses. Usually include demographics at the end of the survey for closure.
10.  There should be adequate “white space” to keep the instrument looking clean  and orderly
11.  Need to guard against biased questions (Ask yourself if any terms used in the questions are culturally “loaded”. Try creating multiple versions of questions and think about whether any of the versions are more likely to produce certain responses. It can be helpful to get specific feedback from an objective colleague).
12.  Need terms that are unambiguous in their meaning. If you try the survey out by asking the questions face-to-face and have to explain any terms or what you mean by a question, it’s not clear enough. Be sure to define terms for the respondent that will be the same for the researcher.
13.  Be sure the items are positively stated. It is sometimes hard to see the word “not” in a sentence.
14.  Avoid “double-barreled questions.
15.  Need good, clear directions.
16.  Be sure that your respondents can read and understand the survey ( e.g., young children, ESL respondents).
17.  Length – You can’t include all the possibilities.
18.  Consider or allow for an “other Comments” section
19.  Try to pilot the survey, if possible.

####  Implementation

1.  Think about who and what you’re asking when determining what method for survey collection (e-mail, phone, in person).
2.  The logistics of reaching your sample population can be tricky.
3.  Easier to answer/interpret/collect quantitative data using this method than interviews, artifacts, or observation.
4.  Hard to get a good response rate.
5.  Specific questions provide specific and sometimes limited answers.
6.  You can’t explain or clarify questions (you can not clarify whether responses were due to misinterpretation and you can not seek answers to non-responses).
7.  If you conduct an anonymous survey, you can not go back to the same people to get more information from them (Among other things, this means you can not take into account or control for variations in personal characteristics, unless you captured them in the survey questions.
8.  To be statistically relevant, one usually needs a pool of at least 50\. However that assumes that the characteristics and circumstances of the respondents make them a good sample of the larger population of interest. Another approach is to pick a sample of individuals who reflect particular characteristics and come from a well-defined context. By providing good, thick description of the context and personal characteristics of the sample, one allows others to draw reasonable conclusions about how the research results might be useful in other contexts and persons, even if the sample is small.

#### Other Comments on the Survey Method

1.  One of the strengths of survey research is that, because it generally results in consistent categories of data and types of responses, it provides data that is generally easier to aggregate and summarize.
2.  Can be a focus or guide to future research.
3.  Can be quick and easy (quick response).
4.  Results can be superficial, without other means of data.
5.  Because the researcher arbitrarily decides what is included in the survey, s/he arbitrarily decides what is important and gets attention.
6.  Forced choice questions mean that the researcher has arbitrarily chosen the response categories. The researcher should document how these decisions were made (e.g., based upon existing literature, previous findings, etc.)
7.  On the other hand, it can be difficult to analyze open-ended responses because there may not be a clear pattern to the variety of responses.
8.  A short (e-mail) survey can be a good pre-activity to prepare for a later interview with the same participant.
9.  There are differences in a completely anonymous written survey, an informal survey given to all participants in a specific setting at a specific time, and e-mail surveys conducted by phone or orally in person.

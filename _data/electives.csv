The course is organized as a seminar and will blend foundational studies in institutional theory with contemporary work, from sociology, organization sciences, education and nonprofit studies. An overarching theme of the course addresses how new practices and organizational forms spread (diffusion), how they stick (institutionalization) and how they take the form that they do (emergence). Topics covered will include accountability and performance; organizational learning; contemporary debates about social mechanisms, and micro-foundations of institutional theory. Ideally, this course will provide a platform for students to develop and advance their own research projects, in the form of a research proposal, for beginning doctoral students, or an empirical analysis for more advanced students."
spring,TGS,LRN_SCI 477,Philosophical and Historical Foundations of Education Reform,,"In this course we will investigate the patterns that emerge in major reform movements of past centuries. After considering several accounts of the roots of education reform, we turn to the scientific management reforms of the early 20th century, John Dewey and the Progressive schools movement, the curricular critiques of math and science education of the Sputnik era, the self correcting critiques of school reform of the late 1960's and 70's, the constructivist teaching for understanding movement of the late 80's and 90's, and the accountability movement of recent years. The goal of the course will be to determine a) to what degree different reforms emerged from their conditions and sponsored subsequent reforms b) what patterns emerge in the ebb and flow of reform movements, and c) how to make 'big picture' sense of the patterns in reform movements. During the class, students will be responsible for making a presentation critiquing different readings. welfare aspects of taxation and public expenditure decisions, budgeting, public investment, external costs and benefits, and public debt. the sports industry, with emphasis placed on managing public relations.

The last decade has seen a resurgence in the economies of some major cities -- especially the global cities of this course's title -- while other post-industrial cities continue a long decline. Cities are now being transformed by the information revolution much as cities were transformed by the industrial revolution two centuries ago. In this course, students will develop an understanding of urbanization, including how city form differs depending on when a city experiences its greatest growth, and how globalization produces increasing disparity (in many ways) between rich and poor.

Most of the available research to-date has investigated race/ethnicity, social class, and gender as the identifying characteristics of students with important implications for educational access, success and learning. However, these are not the only contexts with educational implications, and I would welcome contributions to the class (written or oral) that expand our understanding of other student contexts (examples include disability, language, religion, or sexuality). This course looks across educational domains and draws connections between the K-12 and undergraduate educational settings. The parallels are abundant as social policies increasingly address the notion of a seamless K-16 educational system. The format of the course will consist of large group lecture/discussion for the first 60-90 minutes each week, followed by small group discussions led by TAs for the remainder of the class time."

In this course, we will discuss both the biological myth and social reality of race. Specifically, this course provides an overview of the prominent theories/theorists of race and ethnicity, and is concerned with: 1) Understanding the early science of race used to justify racial classification and thinking, 2) reviewing the theories regarding the nature and persistence of race and ethnicity as meaningful social groupings in society, and 3) explaining the social significance of these group identities (e.g., how they are related to social stratification, social-cultural relations, and the political and economic dynamics in society).We will begin our review with the origins of the concept race, then move from early perspectives to the present in an aim to understand the influential theories and theorists. As we proceed in our investigation we will continuously ask: 1) What are the key assumptions, propositions and concepts of each theory?, 2) How is the theory located within the larger theoretical tradition? 3) Does this theory agree or disagree with other views in the field? 4) What is the level of empirical support for the theory? 5) To what extent does the theory help to explain contemporary patterns of race and ethnicity across time and space in the United States?"

The course focuses on understanding how individuals, families, and groups acquire, consume, and dispose of goods, services, ideas, brands, and experiences. The goal is to deeply understand people’s goals, what people actually do, the meanings behind their activities, and the experiences they seek in order to better understand them as consumers. To do this, we will examine psychological, economic, communications, anthropological and sociological perspectives on human action that will allow us to generate consumer insights.

We have to learn how to communicate in these environments and with people who often communicate quite differently than we do. In order to be efficient in our communication, we must be aware of our own communication strengths and weaknesses. We consciously and unconsciously are determining the audience we are communicating with, in order to tailor our message for effectiveness. In this day and age, digital communication plays an important and necessary role, as well.

#### Observational Research Notes 

When we do observation research we need to be selective, that is why it is important to have a focus, question, or central problem to return to as data collection continues.

Ask yourself these types of questions when doing observational research: What do you see, hear, and experience? What does it mean? What do others see? What does it mean? 

Various methods of collecting observational data exist (e.g., field notes, shadowing, video and photos).

Field notes are an excellent example of observation research. They are a written account of what a researcher sees, hears, experiences, and thinks. They help reconstruct dialogue using language that is as close as possible to that which is heard in the setting (e.g., the classroom) ….(and) describe the specifics of (the) setting and instruction. Collecting field notes carefully over a substantial amount of time helps to avoid telling anecdotes without sufficient evidence. These notes help point to patterns and themes that can be supported by the data.

Observational notes do not yield definitive answers, but they do yield insights.

#### Observation Process

##### Preparation

*   Audio-taping or video-taping can be extremely helpful as they allow you to return to the data again and again, to corroborate details or explore new themes or elements.
*   It can be helpful to create a checklist to be sure to capture important dimensions/things during the observation.
*   In truly public places (e.g. a park, museum), there is no need for formal consent. In a school, permission should be sought from both the principal and from whoever is in charge of the particular setting (e.g. classroom teacher).

##### Implementation

*   Dense, descriptive details can be helpful and, if done well, can allow you to return to the data and look for corroboration of new ideas as they emerge.
*   It is important to take accurate and complete notes (audio-taping and video-taping are even better).
*   Sometimes you have to simply observe and record your impressions later --developing a good memory for detail. It is also helpful to have an observation framework that grows from your knowledge of the question topic.
*   Your presence can affect the human dynamics of the situation you are observing. Be honest about who you are and what you are trying to do, so that participants are not constantly guessing about your presence. Try not to draw attention to yourself. If possible, visit on multiple occasions so that participants get used to your presence.
*   It is especially helpful to observe a setting multiple times. This allows you opportunities to corroborate data and can take into account changes in the context or dynamics of a setting across time [e.g. the “good day/bad day” phenomenon]. It also can result in your presence becoming less of a distraction or influence on the situation. It is generally a good idea to do as many observations in the same setting as possible/feasible without becoming a nuisance.

##### Overall Comments on the Method

*   It CAN be objective AND subjective. The researcher can be an objective and distanced observer, but can still be making constant decisions about what to look for and document.
*   It’s hard to focus adequately. This takes practice. Sometimes it can help to define a focus for a given session.
*   It’s difficult to fully capture the atmosphere. Sometimes, photos and video can help. Videos and photos can reveal data through visual images just as much as written text. The power of video analysis can be used as a tool for reflecting and researching classrooms or other settings. Video clubs are a good way to begin the research process and seek out a question or topic to pursue. 

#### Common Questions about Observation Research

*   _How do you interpret the data?_ Stay tuned for end of 407 and 408.
*   _How reliable is your interpretation?_ You can be more confident in your interpretations if you look for corroborating data of different types. It also helps to continually interrogate one’s own assumptions, hopes, and expectations in research memos.
*   _Do we need a consent form to observe human behavior in public settings?_ No
*   _How do we (researchers) keep from influencing the setting?_ [see “IMPLEMENTATION” above]
*   _How many observations should be done?_ [see “IMPLEMENTATION” above]

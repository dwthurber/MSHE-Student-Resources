#### FAFSA (Free Application for Federal Student Aid)

Prospective students should complete the [Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA)](http://www.fafsa.ed.gov/) around the same time as completing their application for admission to determine their eligibility for federal student loans. The FAFSA school code for Northwestern University is 001739.

Returning students must submit a new [Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA)](http://www.fafsa.ed.gov/) each year, even if their financial situation has not changed. The FAFSA school code for Northwestern University is 001739.

Students receiving federal work study funds (also called Federally Funded Internships) must also submit a FAFSA each year that they are enrolled as a student.

#### Federal Student Loans

After determining eligibility via the FAFSA, most matriculated students are able to borrow up to their full cost of attendance, including tuition and a cost of living allowance. Low fixed interest rate federal student loans are available to matriculated students who are enrolled at least half-time (two courses per term) and are citizens or permanent residents of the United States. Continued eligibility for federal student loans requires compliance with [Satisfactory Academic Progress guidelines](http://www.sesp.northwestern.edu/higher-education/files/pdfs/NU_SESP_SAP_Policy1-12.pdf).

#### Private or Alternative Loans

Non-matriculated students and matriculated students registered for fewer than two courses per quarter may be eligible for private or alternative loans. Additional information about private and alternative loans is available at [http://www.northwestern.edu/sfs/financial_aid/student-loans/private-alt/index.html](http://www.northwestern.edu/sfs/financial_aid/student-loans/private-alt/index.html)

Deferring Previous Student LoansIf you have student loans from undergraduate or previous graduate programs you may be able to defer your loan payments while you are a student. Generally you must be enrolled in at least two courses per term to be eligible to defer your loan payments. For help in deferring your loans contact [Colleen Delaney](mailto:c-delaney@northwestern.edu) in Student Financial Services. You can also download the necessary forms to apply for deferment at the [MyCampusLoan](https://www.mycampusloan.com/static/html/forms/index.html) website.

For more information about verifying your enrollment at Northwestern, please visit [The Office of the Registrar](http://www.registrar.northwestern.edu/academic_records/certification-degree-enrollment_verification.html).

#### Student Loan Repayment

Most student loans do not have to be repaid until you leave the university or drop below half-time student status (fewer than 2 courses per quarter). A grace period is usually provided, but the grace period varies for different kinds of loans. You should refer to your original promissory notes for details of when repayment begins for each loan.

Consolidation of loans is often possible to simplify the repayment process. It is important to understand how different repayment and consolidation plans impact your eligiblity for loan forgiveness programs and the amount of interest you will pay on your loans. If you have questions about loan repayment or consolidation contact [Colleen Delaney](mailto:c-delaney@northwestern.edu) in Student Financial Services

#### Student Loan Forgiveness

There are a number of student loan forgiveness programs offered by the federal government, but one program that may be of particular interest to MSHE students and graduates is the Loan Forgiveness for Public Service Employees program.

## Scholarships

#### MSHE Scholarships

Each year the MS in Higher Education Administration and Policy Program offers a number of partial tuition scholarships to the most academically competitive, new applicants. There is no separate application for these scholarships. You may indicate that you would like to be considered for scholarships in the "Financial Aid and Awards" section of the online application form. There is a limited number of awards available, so applicants are strongly encouraged to apply for the early application deadline.

Students admitted during the early admission deadline are typically notified that they have been selected for scholarships and other awards in April. Other applicants and returning students are automatically considered for scholarships and paid internships, but may not be awarded scholarships at the time that they are admitted.

#### Other Scholarships

Students are encouraged to investigate scholarships offered through various civic and professional organizations, foundations, and state agencies. One place to search for scholarships is the [financial aid information web page](http://www.finaid.org/) sponsored by the National Association of Student Aid Administration. Another good resource is Northwestern University's [Office of Fellowships](http://www.northwestern.edu/fellowships/).

Artifact/Archival Methods can be used to provide historical, demographic and personal information, and used to corroborate and challenge other data. Examples include:

*   Diaries, journals, letters, memos, graffiti, notes, scrapbooks, membership lists, institutional newsletters and newspapers, meeting minutes, attendance rates, retention rates, assessment scores, mission statements, computer accessed websites, syllabi
*   Maps, seating charts, films, videos, drawings, paintings, photographs, music
*   Student work (writing samples, tests)
*   Free response text (e.g., e-mail, blogs)

#### Tips on Method/Implementation

*   Many resources available to use (doesn’t always have to be original data)
*   Be clear about and document what you are collecting and why
*   Can ask research participants to produce the artifacts
*   Multiple artifacts can corroborate
*   Try to understand context

#### Examples of Artifact/Archival Analysis from Master's Projects 

##### Example #1:

> What are the factors that influence faculty participation in sponsored scholarship at a non-"very high research activity" university and how can institutional support and policy promote scholarship productivity?

The archival analysis examined the online policies of 21 universities, specifically addressing three types of policies: faculty supplemental compensation, university indirect cost recovery allocation, and external consulting.  These three policies were selected as examples of how other universities structure their research efforts and incentivize their faculty to participate in scholarship.  Schools were selected based on a number of criteria including size, research capacity, reputation and scholarship tradition.  A variety of schools were chosen in an effort to present a range of institution types and to mark any difference in policy between highly active and non-highly active schools.  The schools chosen for analyses are outlined in Table 1 below.

##### Example #2:

> What are the differences in the reported levels of engagement and institutional satisfaction between veteran community college students who participate in veteran student organizations and those that do not?

##### Example #3:

> How does study abroad outside of Israel affect Jewish engagement in Jewish college students?

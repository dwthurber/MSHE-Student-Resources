1.  Define the purpose and objectives
2.  Select resources, possible incentives, and target population
3.  Chose/develop instrument for gathering data
4.  Develop clear instructions
5.  Develop your Administration Plan (sample, timelines, number of reminder, reminder text)
6.  Write letter of Transmittal, Consent
7.  Pilot Test & Revise Instrument
8.  Administer survey
9.  Analyze the Survey Results
10.  Prepare report and share findings

#### Survey Concepts

**Operationalize**

*   Define something (variable, term, construct) in terms of a process needed to determine its existence, duration, quantity.
*   An indicator of the concept attribute within the concept
*   Concepts to variables to indicators

**Levels of Measurement**

*   Nominal (categorical)
*   Ordinal (rank order, but no distance)
*   Interval (scale, distance is meaningful)
*   Ratio (order, spacing, absolute zero)

**Reliability and Validity**

*   Reliability – consistency
*   Validity – accuracy in capturing true meaning
*   Interval (scale, distance is meaningful)
*   Ratio (order, spacing, absolute zero)

#### Qualities of a Good Question

*   Relevant 
*   Evokes the truth
*   Asks for an answer on only one dimension
*   Can accommodate all possible answers
*   Has mutually exclusive options 
*   Produces variability in responses
*   Follows comfortably from the previous question (order)

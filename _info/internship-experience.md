title: Internship Experience
description: There are many different routes a student can take in finding a rewarding internship. Some students start their internship immediately upon entering the program. Others prefer to take a few classes first and research areas of interest before beginning an internship. Doing multiple internships is also a great way to experience different higher education roles and departments to find the best professional fit, while doing a longer-term internship (3 quarters or more) allows students to get in-depth experience and take on a high level of responsibility.

Before registering for courses for the first time there are a few things to be aware of. In order to register for courses, the MSHE program must give you an "enrollment appointment." Dr. Kristin McCann will process your enrollment appointment after receiving the Intention to Register form and the tuition deposit. Depending on when you applied and were accepted, enrollment for your starting quarter may not yet be open (e.g. if you were accepted in January and planning to start in the fall you wouldn't be able to register for courses until fall enrollment opened in late spring.) You will get an email from Kristin letting you know when your enrollment appointment has been set.

#### Course Registration

Students register for courses online through [CAESAR](http://www.northwestern.edu/caesar/). The [CAESAR](http://www.northwestern.edu/caesar/) system can be a bit confusing at first, so we strongly recommend that new students complete the virtual orientation session before registering the first time. This is also where you will see your student account and tuition bill, request that excess loan money be sent to you, view registration holds and see your class schedule (including room numbers). Log into CAESAR with your NetID and NetID password.

Registration typically opens three to six weeks before the start of the quarter. You can see exact dates when registration opens on the academic calendar (and on the calendar on the homepage of this website.) In the fall quarter registration closes the week before classes start and re-opens on the first day of classes. Remember that you will also get an email with suggested electives and a list of required courses offered each quarter around the time that registration begins, so that message can also serve as a reminder to go and register for courses.

The MSLOC program put together this helpful [10-minute video](https://nwuniversity.adobeconnect.com/_a799312996/p3fe6xki0yd/?launcher=false&fcsContent=true&pbMode=normal) about how to register on CAESAR. All of the information is the same for MS_HE students, except that you will choose "MS_HE" under "subject."

##### To search for MS_HE classes in CAESAR:

*   Go to "search for classes" and choose the right term (e.g. summer 2015).
*   On the "subject" drop down menu choose "MS_HE" and on the "career" drop down menu choose "EDG – Education Grad." This will pull up all of our courses for that term.
    *   _Note that if you don't pick the term first you may not see MS_HE on the "subject" drop down menu because "MS_HE" courses weren't listed until fall 2011\._
*   You can search for JUST a career (e.g. EDG) but cannot search for just a subject (e.g. MS_HE). This becomes especially important to remember when searching for elective courses offered through other programs at Northwestern. We generally tell you what career each subject is offered through in the quarterly "suggested electives" email that we send (see more about outside electives below.)
*   Once you've registered for a course it will show up on the main landing page (the "student center") in CAESAR. The course may also appear in Blackboard, but it is not uncommon for instructors to wait to make courses visible to students until closer to the start of the term, so don't assume that you aren't registered just because a course isn't appearing in blackboard.

More registration tips and troubleshooting are available [here](http://www.registrar.northwestern.edu/registration/CAESAR_help.html). If you get stuck feel free to contact [Dr. Kristin McCann](mailto:kristin.mccann1@northwestern.edu).

#### Registration Holds

There are circumstances that will result in a registration or transcript “hold” on a student’s account. If you have a hold you will not be able to register for courses and may be denied access to other services (like requesting a transcript.)

You can see the reason for the hold by logging into CAESAR and clicking the "holds" link on the right hand column of the page. These holds are most commonly placed by the [Office of Student Accounts](http://www.northwestern.edu/sfs/payments/index.html) or [Health Services](http://www.nuhs.northwestern.edu/evanston/Default.aspx). The most common registration hold is because a student has not entered (or updated) their emergency contact information in CAESAR. If you have a hold, you will need to contact the appropriate office to arrange for removal of the hold before you will be able to register or to receive or send a transcript.

#### Dropping Courses

Discuss all changes in your academic plans with your MSHE academic advisor, including a decision to add or drop a class. Students should add and drop courses during the first five days of the quarter (known as add/drop week). You can drop a course on CAESAR, provided you will still be enrolled in at least one course after you drop the course (if this is not the case see "withdrawing from an academic quarter" below.)

Students will not be charged tuition for courses dropped in the first five days of the quarter. The University cannot give refunds or reduce tuition bills for any course dropped after the fifth day of classes. Please note that the policies regarding dropping some (but not all) courses in a quarter differ from the policies related to withdrawing from a quarter (dropping all courses in which you are enrolled). You can find the official Northwestern Policy about tuition refunds on the [Student Financial Services website](http://www.northwestern.edu/sfs/tuition/registration_refunds.html#Refunds2).

Courses dropped after the first five days of classes (add/drop week) but before the "last day to drop" date will not appear on your transcript or impact GPA, but (as mentioned above) you will be charged tuition. To see the add/drop and final drop deadlines for each quarter [visit the registrar's website](http://www.registrar.northwestern.edu/registration/index.html). Also, see the grades for dropped courses information on the Academic Expectations page.

##### Cancellation (dropping all of your courses in a quarter)

If you will be dropping all of your courses in a quarter you will not be able to do so in CAESAR. You should contact Dr. Kristin McCann at [kristin.mccann1@northwestern.edu](mailto:kristin.mccann1@northwestern.edu) and she will fill out a paper form to drop you from your courses. This includes cases where students were signed up for only one course and then needed to drop the course.

#### Course Evaluations (CTEC) and Feedback

The MSHE Program Office and MSHE instructors value feedback from students to improve future course offerings. At the completion of each of your courses, you will receive an e-mail from the NU Registrar’s Office asking you to complete an on-line CTEC form (Course and Teacher Evaluation Council), a generalized evaluation form for classes across the University. This information is then compiled and made accessible to students.

Please note that if you do not fill out CTECs for all courses in which you are enrolled you will not have access to CTEC reports for the next quarter. Viewing CTECs for past offerings of a course is especially helpful when selecting electives.

In addition to the CTECs, you are also encouraged to provide feedback and voice concerns about courses to your advisor and/or the program Director. We also gather information about the courses and overall curriculum in the exit survey sent to graduating students each year.

#### About {{ page.title }}

##### What do you do when you get an offer?

1. Say, “Thank you!” Show enthusiasm. **(Do not accept immediately!)**
2. If you receive a verbal offer, ask for it in writing.
3. Say, “I’m very grateful for this opportunity. Since this is my first post-master’s degree position, I’d like to be thoughtful about it and consider the terms of the offer. May I get back to you with any questions that come up, please?” **(Do not negotiate immediately!)**
4. Do your homework.
  * Research/double-check salary information.
  * Connect with your network.
  * Review benefits information online, if you haven’t already.
  * Evaluate the offer, and, if appropriate, prepare to negotiate.

##### Negotiate for the Win/Win!

* It’s not a conflict; it’s a conversation. At its best, it is a collaborative, problem-solving endeavor.
* The goal is not to win, but to seek an elegant, win-win agreement.
* Consider this your first project with your future colleagues. Strengthening relationships is paramount to your success.

###### Do’s and Don’ts

**DO:**

* negotiate in person (preferably) or by phone, first with the hiring manager
* present your ideal “package,” and state your priorities
* frame requests with research, justification, and benefits to employer
* strive to understand the employer’s priorities and limitations
* use collaborative questions

**DON’T:**

* negotiate by email
* negotiate one item at a time
* say, “I deserve…”
* divulge confidential information about someone else’s salary
* disregard an employer’s feedback during the negotiation
process

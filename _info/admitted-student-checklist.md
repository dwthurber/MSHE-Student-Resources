New students should also pay attention to the "to-do lists" that appear in the right hand navigation panel in CAESAR. Tasks on the CAESAR checklist may include things you need to do to have student loans disbursed or to enable you to register for courses. Therefore, it is important that you pay attention to those items as well.

If you have any questions about any of the things listed here feel free to contact the MSHE office.

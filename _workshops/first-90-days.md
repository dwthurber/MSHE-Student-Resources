#### 10 Success Strategies for the First 90 Days of a New Job 

(adapted from The First 90 Days by Michael Watkins)

1. **Prepare Yourself.** Think about the transition ahead of time and the complexities involved:
  * Is it a whole new organization or department? 
  * Is it a newly created role? How much definition exists around the role?
  * Is the department, unit or institution going through significant change or growth?
2. **Accelerate Your Learning.**  You will be learning your new job, of course, but it is also important to understand the organization/department’s mission & objectives, key players, success metrics and culture. Ask people for talks. Key questions: 
    * How did we get to this point? 
    * Why are things done this way? 
    * What have the goals been?
    * Who are the key players, past present and future? 
    * What are the biggest challenges faced, past, present and future? 
    * How do you think that I can add value in this role?
3. **Establish a productive working relationship with your boss.**
  * Figure out: expectations, working style, resources, personal development and communication (how/how often)? It’s OK to express your preferences (e.g. autonomy, lots of feedback, flexibility, frequent check-ins), but it’s your responsibility to adapt to your boss’s style, not vice versa. 
  * Don’t surprise your boss with bad news; loop them in early; don’t approach a boss only with problems. Try to offer solutions when you broach challenges.
4. **Match your strategy to the situation and workplace.**
  * What is the preferred mode of communication (Email? Informal chats? Scheduled meetings?) 
  * What can be delegated and what must you do yourself? 
  * How is conflict handled? Is it okay to openly air grievances or debate and argue?
5. **Build credibility, win trust, create value and improve results early on.**
  * Is there something that you can do quickly, with modest expenditure of time, money and effort, that will yield operational or organizational gain? Can you remove a bottleneck? 
  * Caveat: Don’t force it.
6. **Align your efforts with organizational priorities.**
  * Figure out the strategy and ask yourself how you can advance it. Speaking in terms of overarching strategy will show your boss and teammates that you grasp the big picture. 
  * Keeping strategy/mission in mind can help you make decisions.
7. **(if taking on direct reports) Build your Team.**
  * If you are taking on direct reports, you need to evaluate, align and mobilize them. 
  * Willingness to make tough personal calls and select the right people for the right positions are key success drivers. 
  * Be respectful. Listen. Ask questions. In meetings, ask quiet people for their view. 
  * Praise, but also offer honest feedback. 
  * Don't trust your first impressions completely. 
  * Eventually, you will have to articulate a vision for your team. The more it dovetails with organizational strategy, the better. 
  * Once you have articulated a vision, reinforce, reinforce, reinforce.  Establish regular communications. Convey expectations. Celebrate success.
8. **Create Coalitions – success doesn’t happen in a vacuum!**
  * Think about key stakeholders and people you rely on to make things happen. Befriend them and build networks across the organization. “Map the influence network.”
  * Put yourself in the shoes of others. How can you help them and why is it in their interest to help you? 
  * Aristotle’s framework for explaining human behavior:  People act for reasons of Logos, Ethos and Pathos (Logos is logic, Ethos is values. Pathos is emotion). Appeal to people on all levels!
9. **Keep your balance.**
  * Transitions can be difficult! You must preserve your ability to focus on the important stuff, avoid losing perspective and make good decisions. 
  * Be careful about overcommitting, failing to set boundaries early on, becoming isolated or avoiding conflict or tough conversations. 
  * Take stock of how you’re doing emotionally throughout. If you’re feeling overwhelmed, don’t suffer in silence.
10. **Show gratitude and respect for people’s time and experience.** 
  * Your transition also means transition for people around you! Thank people for taking time out to train you or share insights with you. 
  * Take advantage of orientation materials or programs already developed. 
  * Ask others how they got up to speed. 
  * If there are areas where you can start contributing early, go for it!

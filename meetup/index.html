        <h3>Why MeetUp?</h3>
        <p>MeetUps are like an informational interview. Students will share their background and goals in advance, and come to the conversation with a clear learning objective. They will also share the latest MSHE developments. From the students' perspective, the purpose of the MeetUp is to learnâ€”not to seek a job from Alumni. Alumni can learn about the exciting new career paths of MSHE students.</p>
        <p>The engagement allows students and alumni to expand their networks by meeting someone with similar interests. Although the expectation is for only a single meeting, the relationship can be developed if both participants choose.</p>

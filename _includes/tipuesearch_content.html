MeetUps are like an informational interview. Students will share their background and goals in advance, and come to the conversation with a clear learning objective. They will also share the latest MSHE developments. From the students' perspective, the purpose of the MeetUp is to learnâ€”not to seek a job from Alumni. Alumni can learn about the exciting new career paths of MSHE students.", "tags": "", "url": "{{ site.baseurl }}/meetup/"},

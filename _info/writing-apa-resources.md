title: Writing/APA Resources
description: >-
  In your time as a student in the MSHE program you will have several occasions
  to search for research articles and write papers about those articles. The
  most obvious example of this is the Master's Project literature review, but
  you'll likely use the resources outlined on this page in every course you
  take.

#### APA Style Resources

[Sample APA paper](https://northwestern.box.com/shared/static/xd1cdszuvc4zqz1bc4xsj1c4bj76ttji.pdf)

All MSHE courses require students to cite sources using APA (American Psychological Association) style. Students are expected to follow the citation guidelines of the most recent version of the APA publication manual. The APA manual is listed as a required text for the Proseminar and for all three courses of the Master's Project Sequence.

For quick reference we also recommend [Purdue OWL APA guide](http://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/section/2/10/). This guide is not intended to replace the APA manual and does not include information about all kinds of citations/situations.

APA Formatting and APA TemplateTo help with setting up your paper in APA style, including headers, title page, page numbers and table of contents, students are encouraged to use [this template](https://sesp.box.com/shared/static/lgqwax92o5crl4xnenkn.docx), created by the MSHE office. Please note that if you make correctly use the templates headers and subheaders the table of contents will automatically generate with page numbers.

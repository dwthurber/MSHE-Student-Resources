#### Academic Integrity

All students enrolled in the MSHE Program are expected to adhere to the standards for academic integrity. We specially address the policies of academic integrity because of the serious nature of violations: a violation of academic integrity guidelines for MSHE and Northwestern University can lead to a reduced or failing grade in the course (as determined by the course instructor), suspension and dismissal from the MSHE program. Students who violate these standards will be sanctioned as is deemed appropriate by the course instructor, the MSHE Program Director, and the Dean of the School of Education and Social Policy.

It is very important, therefore, that you understand the definitions and examples of academic integrity. The MSHE program adheres to the [academic integrity policies set forth by Northwestern University](http://www.northwestern.edu/provost/students/integrity/). If you have any questions about academic dishonesty, please contact your MSHE Academic Advisor or the Program Director.

Instructors commonly choose to use the “Turn it in” tool provided by the University that allows easy review of students’ written work against a large database of published, scholarly work to check for plagiarism. Students are expected to be conversant with current guidelines for proper citation of others’ work. The MSHE Program adheres to American Psychological Association (APA) style guidelines.

#### Grading

Criteria for and evaluation of performance are at the discretion of the instructor. Expectations and how they are being met will be communicated to students via the course syllabus and feedback throughout the term. If you need clarity regarding expectations for class participation, team work or course deliverables, please discuss them with your respective instructor.

#### Class Attendance

Class Attendance It is expected that students should plan to attend all class meetings. Of course, there are occasions where students need to miss a class. If you need to miss a class because of an illness or emergency contact your instructor as soon as possible to let them know that you cannot be in class. Some instructors may assign additional work to make up for the absence. If you have to miss a class for a scheduled event (work, a conference, travel) discuss the issue with your instructor as soon as you can, preferably before the start of the quarter. We recommend that if you know that you will have to miss more than two class meetings, you should not enroll in the course. The instructor for the course has overall discretion regarding how your overall grade for the class will be impacted due to absences.

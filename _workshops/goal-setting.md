More than 1 million people have used StrengthsQuest to gain insights into how to use their talents to achieve academic success, to explore careers, and in leadership development." Additionally, in Spring 2015, Dr. Adam Goodman's Leadership Coaching course required that students complete a StrengthsQuest Assessment. StrengthsQuest is very common among student affairs professionals (some even list their strengths in their signature lines), and it is highly recommended that students consider completing an assessment.</span></span>

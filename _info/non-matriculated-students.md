#### Non-Matriculated Status 

Policies regarding the academic status of non-matriculated students are available on this site on the "Student Status" page.

#### Financial Resources for Non-Matriculated Students

Many types of financial assistance (including federal student loans, MSHE scholarships and federally funded internships) are not available to non-matriculated students. However, many non-matriculated students are eligible for private or alternative student loans. Additional information about private and alternative loans is available at [www.northwestern.edu/sfs/loan_instruc_info/private_loans.html.](http://www.northwestern.edu/sfs/loan_instruc_info/private_loans.html) Colleen Delaney in Student Financial Services can also answer questions about these loans and give help and guidance to students seeking all types of loans. Colleen can be contacted at [c-delaney@northwestern.edu](mailto:c-delaney@northwestern.edu) or 847-491-8950.

#### Applying for Matriculation 

Non-matriculated students can apply for matriculation at any point prior to enrolling in their fifth course (unless their initial acceptance letter stated that they must complete a certain number of courses before applying to matriculate.) Before submitting the application for matriculation, we strongly advise students to talk with their academic advisor about their application to ensure that they are presenting the strongest possible application.

In order to apply for matriculation you need to begin a new application in [Apply Yourself](https://app.applyyourself.com/?id=nwu-sesp) - you cannot re-use your initial application for admission.

Starting a new app isn't really intuitive. I'm including a screen shot, as I've found that a photo can be worth a thousand words. Basically, when you go on to the log-in screen you'll see your own info already filled out. Ignore that, and right below click "create new account."

Once you fill in your name, email etc you may see a warning that says "there is already an application with this email address." Just say that that's alright by you and continue on to start the application.

When you start your application choose "non-matriculated to matriculated" under "application type" (not "matriculated.) If you would like to re-use any materials that you submitted with your first application, including letters of recommendation, essays, transcripts and GRE scores, please contact Erin McNulty at [mshe-apply@northwestern.edu](mailto:mshe-apply@northwestern.edu) after you submit your application and she will transfer the materials to your new application.

The materials required for completing the non-matriculated to matriculated application include:

*   All essay questions required on the application
*   An updated resume
*   Two letters of recommendation, one of which must be an academic reference (many students applying for matriculation ask an MSHE instructor to serve as their academic reference.)
*   Official copy of your GRE scores
*   A $100 application processing fee
*   NOTE: You do not need to submit your MSHE transcript. The MSHE staff will download the transcript before the application is sent for review.

Important elements for consideration regarding admission into the degree program are the student’s grade record in the program and in previous coursework, GRE scores, recommendations, and his/her contribution to and participation in the MSHE community. Input could be solicited from MSHE staff and instructors in whose classes the student was enrolled regarding the quality of the applicant’s participation in the classroom as well as his/her contribution to the community.

The average scores of successful applications (posted [here on the MSHE website](http://www.sesp.northwestern.edu/higher-education/admissions/index.html)) are a useful guideline for students hoping to matriculate. Some students also have specific parameters for applying for matriculation on their initial non-matriculated acceptance letter.

If you have any questions about the application procedure please contact Erin McNulty at [mshe-apply@northwestern.edu](mailto:mshe-apply@northwestern.edu) or Kristin McCann at [kristin.mccann1@northwestern.edu](mailto:kristin.mccann1@northwestern.edu).

#### About Letters of Recommendation

Here's how the recommendation system works: When you enter the names and email addresses of your recommenders the system sends them an automated email right away. The email looks something like this:

![Letter of Recommendation Example](https://northwestern.box.com/shared/static/d5onc5j87n80e2gt6igyd935enmyg12t.png)

You can see it is pretty generic, so you'll want to reach out to your recommenders in advance to let them know that you've listed them as recommenders.

Up to the time that you submit the application you can remind recommenders who have not yet submitted the recommendation by logging into the application and then clicking "remind" in the recommendation providers section.

You can submit your application even if we haven't yet received your letters of recommendation, but we cannot process the application until we have the recommendation (and all other parts of the application.) Your application will still be considered "on time" even if your recommenders submit after the deadline.

Once you've submitted your application you won't be able to send automatic reminders to your recommenders, but the MSHE office can do so for you. Just contact mshe-apply@northwestern.edu.

Let your advisor know if you have any other questions.

#### Petitioning to Take a Fifth Class as a Non-Matriculated Student

Non-matriculated students are allowed to take up to four classes. This policy is intended to protect non-matriculated students while still giving them a sufficient opportunity to get to know the program and to display their academic capabilities. However, there are some situations in which a non-matriculated student may have valid reasons for wishing to take a fifth course. When this is the case the student should complete and submit the [Petition to Take an Additional Course as a Non-Matriculated Student Form](https://sesp.box.com/shared/static/i629khgbe9soc0skxre4.pdf).

#### After you Matriculate

##### Update your Academic Plan

After you have a been accepted as a matriculated student you should schedule a meeting with your academic advisor to update your program plan and discuss courses and professional goals. If you will be completing an internship you should also schedule a meeting with Lois Trautvetter to begin the internship search process.

##### Search for Internships 

Once you matriculate you are eligible to get credit for an internship. If you are interested in having an internship the first step is to meet with the program Director, Lois Trautvetter, to talk about your professional interests and needs in terms of the internship. Contact Lois to schedule a meeting. More information about internships is available on internships page of this site.

##### Federal Student Loans

Your eligibility for federal loans may have changed since you became a matriculated student. If you are taking at least two courses in some quarters and are a citizen or permanent resident of the United States and are interested in getting Federal Student Loans you should contact Colleen Delaney in Student Financial Services at [c-delaney@northwestern.edu](mailto:c-delaney@northwestern.edu) or 847-491-8950.

Anyone requesting Federal Student Loans must complete and submit the [Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA)](http://www.fafsa.ed.gov/) to determine their eligibility for federal student loans. The FAFSA school code for Northwestern University is 001739.

##### Financial Awards

Once you have been accepted as a matriculated student you are automatically considered for scholarships. If you are awarded a scholarship you will be notified in writing when the scholarship is awarded (this does not necessarily occur at the time that you are accepted for matriculation and is highly dependent on how many award funds are available.

You are also eligible for paid internships, granted that you meet other eligibility requirements (full-time enrollment etc.) Meet with the program Director, Lois Trautvetter, to begin the process of searching for an internship.

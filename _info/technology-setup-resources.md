#### Connecting to the Northwestern Wireless Network

The first time you connect to NU's wireless network you will need to configure your machine. See instructions at [www.it.northwestern.edu/oncampus/wireless/index.html](http://www.it.northwestern.edu/oncampus/wireless/index.html)

#### Setting up VPN

Set up your VPN (virtual private network) connection, which will allow you to access Northwestern systems including electronic library resources and the Chronicle of Higher Education site from off campus. Instructions for setting up your VPN connection are available at [www.it.northwestern.edu/oncampus/vpn/](http://www.it.northwestern.edu/oncampus/vpn/)

#### About your @u.northwestern email

It is very important that students check their Northwestern email address regularly, as official messages about registration, billing, graduation, campus emergencies and other issues will go to the Northwestern email address. Faculty and administrators of the MS in Higher Education Administration and Policy program will also use the NU email address to communicate with students.

If you go to [www.gmail.com](http://www.gmail.com/) you'll put your full u.northwestern email address in the "username/email" field and the password that you established for the email account (which may be different from your NetID password) into the password field. u.northwestern email sign

More information about u.northwestern email accounts, including how add the account to your smartphone, etc. is available [here](http://www.it.northwestern.edu/mobility/index.html).

#### Forwarding your u.northwestern email to another email account

Instructions on how to forward your u.northwestern.edu email address to another inbox are available at [https://support.google.com/mail/answer/10957](https://support.google.com/mail/answer/10957)

Email information for MSHE students who are also full-time NU staff

Staff of Northwestern who become students in the MSHE program have two options for email. They can use their regular northwestern.edu email account as their student account OR they can set up a separate u.northwestern.edu email account for messages related to their student status.

To set up a u.northwestern account go to [https://umail.northwestern.edu/index.html](https://umail.northwestern.edu/index.html). Then contact Kristin McCann at [kristin.mccann1@northwestern.edu](mailto:kristin.mccann1@northwestern.edu) to ask that she add your new u.northwestern.edu email account to the listserv.

If for any reason you are not able to establish a U.northwestern account send an email to [consultant@northwestern.edu](mailto:consultant@northwestern.edu) and ask NUIT to establish at u.northwestern.edu account for you (explain in the message that you're going to be a part-time student in addition to a staff member. They will establish the account on your behalf.

The advantages of having a u.northwestern account are that you will continue to have access to that account even after you leave the university (your other NU email address will expire when you no longer have an active NetID.) The other advantage is that you can get to this student resources site by logging into your email and clicking "sites" at the top of the page.

#### Transfer Credit

The MSHE program does not allow transfer credits from other universities. All students must take 15 graduate-level courses to earn the master's degree. If you have taken a course in another graduate program that is the same as one of the required MSHE courses, you can petition to waive the course and take an elective in its place.

#### FERPA and Right to Privacy

The MSHE Program follows the Northwestern University guidelines for access to student records and directory information, which are based on the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) of 1974\. For additional information, see [www.registrar.northwestern.edu/academic_records/FERPA_policy.html](http://www.registrar.northwestern.edu/academic_records/FERPA_policy.html)

#### Grade Changes

A student or instructor may request a grade change, most often to correct a clerical or computational error or to change an incomplete grade to a final grade. The right and responsibility to assess the quality of your work remains with your instructor. If you are dissatisfied with your grade in a class, we encourage you to communicate with the instructor. If you remain dissatisfied, you may contact the Director of the program. However, the Director does not have the authority to change a grade assigned by an instructor without the consent of the instructor.

#### Taking an Incomplete (Y Grades)

In general, students are expected to complete all work in all courses by the appropriate deadline, as outlined in each course's syllabus. However, there are occasions where a student is unable to complete their coursework before the end of the quarter (for example, due to an illness or family emergency.) In these cases students may be able to take an incomplete in the course and finish the course requirements at a later date.

It is important to note that you must get the permission of the instructor to take an incomplete in a course. You and the instructor must agree upon a time when you will finish the work for the course. If you do not communicate with the instructor and fail to turn in final assignments or attend classes an "F" grade may be assigned.

Incomplete courses appear as a “Y” grade on your transcript and count as an "F" in your GPA. Once you have turned in all of your work and your instructor has submitted a grade change the "Y" will be completely replaced by the new grade.

We highly recommend that you reconcile "Y" grades within one quarter. Students who are receiving federal student loans should also be aware of how the Y grade impacts their eligibility in regards to the [Satisfactory Academic Progress](https://sesp.box.com/shared/static/8f37c2ec2978b0130140.pdf) guidelines. You must resolve the incomplete grade within one year from the term in which you earned the "Y" grade or the "Y" will be permanent (exceptions may be made in the case of a medical leave of absence). For instance, if you receive an incomplete in a course during the fall term, you must complete the work, and your instructor must submit a change of grade request by the end of finals week during the following fall term. [See the official NU policy on resolving Y grades here](http://www.registrar.northwestern.edu/academic_records/Change-Of-Grade-Policies.html).

#### Grades for Dropped Courses

Withdrawals in the Fall, Winter, and Spring quarters with an "Effective Date" through the end of the 6th week of classes will result in an entry on the transcript documenting the withdrawal date. Withdrawals with an "Effective Date" after the end of the 6th week will result in the withdrawn courses, with grades of "W", being listed on the transcript along with the withdrawal date.

#### Pass/No Pass

Pass/No Pass All eleven required MSHE courses and all electives must be taken for a grade. There is not a pass/no pass (P/N) option for these courses. If you elect to take a course as pass/no pass during your time as an MSHE student, that course will not count toward the 15 courses required to earn the degree.

#### Auditing Courses

In general, auditing MSHE courses is not permitted. If you have questions please contact the Program Director.

#### Academic Probation

In matters regarding satisfactory academic progress and parameters for academic probation, the MS in Higher Education Administration and Policy Program utilizes the [policies established by The Graduate School at Northwestern University](http://www.tgs.northwestern.edu/about/policies/general-registration-policies.html#grades). The decision to place a student on academic probation or dismiss him or her from the program is at the discretion of the MS in Higher Education Administration and Policy Program Director.

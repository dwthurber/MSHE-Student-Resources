<h3>Definition</h3>
<p>Findings which are reduced and displayed appropriately. The Data Summary should:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Include<strong> an introduction </strong>that lays out structure and content of data results and relevant analysis performed.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Present and <strong>describes the data in an unbiased, accurate, complete manner.&nbsp; </strong></li>
<li>Present<strong>&nbsp;data</strong><strong>/evidence that is&nbsp;appropriate (type and quality) to the research question.&nbsp; </strong></li>
<li>Present<strong>&nbsp;</strong>data/evidence that is&nbsp;<strong>reduced and displayed in a useful way</strong>.</li>
<li>Include<strong> Graphs </strong><strong>and tables that are&nbsp;clear and contain appropriate labels. </strong></li>
<li>If statistical analysis performed, include sufficient information to help the reader understand the analysis conducted.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Include a <strong>brief conclusion that summarizes the data results</strong> (not discussion/interpretation).</li>
</ul>
<h3>Purpose</h3>
<h3>Process</h3>
<p>Questions to ask as you work with the data:</p>
<ul>
<li>What questions are you trying to answer and what do you specifically want to show?</li>
<li>Who is the audience of this data?</li>
<li>What types of data do you have and what are the key relationships?</li>
</ul>
<h4>Data Visualization:&nbsp;Two Phases</h4>
<h5>Phase 1: What to Visualize</h5>
<p>Consider your inputs</p>
<ul>
<li>Your goals
<ul>
<li>What questions are you trying to answer?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Their needs
<ul>
<li>Who is the data consumer and what do you want them to know?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Shape of the data
<ul>
<li>What type of data are you working with?
<ul>
<li>Categorical (grouped - sex)</li>
<li>Ordinal (ranked - satisfaction)</li>
<li>Interval (scales, temperature)</li>
<li>Ratio (age, salary)</li>
<li>Relational (hierarchical)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h5>Phase 2: How to Visualize</h5>
<p>Organize your data with goals in mind</p>
<ul>
<li>Show relationship of A and B?</li>
<li>Compare two points in time?</li>
<li>Compare/Contrast?</li>
<li>Table or Chart?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Tables vs. Charts/Graphs</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Tables
<ul>
<li>To look up individual values</li>
<li>To compare individual values</li>
<li>When precise values are required</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Charts
<ul>
<li>When the message is in the pattern</li>
<li>To revel relationships among multiple values
<ul>
<li>Use stacked-bar chart for part-to-whole relationships to present cumulative totals</li>
<li>Use bar graphs over pie charts to show groups comparison</li>
<li>Use a line graph if the x-axis can show interval data</li>
<li>Used a scatterplot to show correlations</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Reporting Data Results</h4>
<ul>
<li>Be impartial in the write-up, avoid value-laden statements</li>
<li>Do not use first person, allow the readers to see the research through the data and their own eyes</li>
<li>Should be able to replicate the study and come to the same conclusions</li>
<li>Include representative samples for a theme</li>
<li>Not interesting or nonessential data should be in appendices, if appropriate</li>
<li>Use numerals greater than or equal to 10; dates, ages or time; reporting the participants, reporting scores</li>
<li>Using words for quantification &ndash; values less than 10, Numbers that begin sentences</li>
<li>Numerical data should be reported in descending order</li>
<li>Use tables and figures to organize data, but also refer to them in the text. Don&rsquo;t forget to use APA format.</li>
</ul>

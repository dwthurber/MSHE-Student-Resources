#### Interactive campus map&nbsp;

The [interactive campus map](http://maps.northwestern.edu/#latlngz=41.972%2C-87.655%2C12) allows you to search for buildings on the Evanston or Chicago campus by name or address. Once you've located a building you can scroll down on the pop-up window and get driving or walking directions from any address.

Campus Tours The NU Office of Undergraduate Admission offers tours of the campus every day (and twice a day in the summers). The tours are preceded by a 45 minute information session, which is focused on information for prospective undergraduates. You can sign up for tours and see the times that tours are offered [here](http://www.ugadm.northwestern.edu/visit/plan-your-visit/visit-calendar.html). If you plan to attend the tour but not the information session you should arrive at the admission office 40 minutes after the time of the information session.

Virtual Tours of Campus Virtual tours and snapshots of campus are an [easy alternative](http://www.northwestern.edu/campus-life/virtual-tour.html).

#### Fitness and Recreation

There are several fitness and recreation services available to students, many of them free.

[Evanston Campus Sports and Aquatics Fitness Center (SPAC)](http://www.fitrec.northwestern.edu/)

Free to full-time students, reduced prices for part-time students, faculty and staff.

Includes group exercise classes, pool, cardio equipment, racquetball courts etc.

A note about SPAC access during the summer months: According to SPAC's [website](http://www.fitrec.northwestern.edu/membership/student.html) students taking 2 courses during the summer get automatic free access to the center. However, some students who started in the summer quarter and were taking only 2 courses were not able to access SPAC, so we called to clarify the situation. SPAC informed us that their website is out of date and that the policy on summer enrollment is in flux. Currently any student who was enrolled full-time in the SPRING automatically gets free access through the summer, but students who start in the summer and are only taking 2 classes don't automatically get free access and would have to wait until the fall quarter starts.

[Chicago Campus facilities - River East Club](http://www.northwestern.edu/uservices/fitness/chicago_campus.html)

This fitness center is not owned by Northwestern but they do have a partnership and NU students get a large discount on memberships.

Membership at the River East Club also gives you full access to services offered by the Chicago Park District.

[Northwestern Beach](http://www.fitrec.northwestern.edu/facilities/beach/)

Northwestern University has a private beach staffed with lifeguards during the summer months. Students (part-time or full-time) can use the beach for free but must present their student ID (wildcard).

[Northwestern Sailing Center](http://www.fitrec.northwestern.edu/facilities/sailing/index.html)

#### Health and Wellness

Services at the Evanston facility include general medicine, women’s health (gynecology), infirmary (limited inpatient care), health education, access to specialty consultations, allergy shots, travel immunizations, laboratory, radiology (X-ray), and pharmacy. Students do NOT have to have the NU Health Insurance to utilize Health Services.

[Health Insurance](http://www.nuhs.northwestern.edu/evanston/insurance.aspx)

Northwestern offers health insurance through Aetna. Premiums are the same for part-time students as for full-time (for 2013-14 that is $3,067 for the year).

Full time students will select or waive the NU insurance on CAESAR. If you don't waive the insurance by the deadline you will be charged for it.

Part-time students need to contact the health services office at 847 491-2110 (Evanston Campus), 312-503-1242 (Chicago Campus) or e-mail [student.insurance@northwestern.edu](mailto:student.insurance@northwestern.edu) to request a “Part Time Application” form to enroll in the health insurance plan. Part-time and half-time students cannot enroll via CAESAR. Note that you must be taking at least two classes towards a degree to enroll in health insurance. Non-degree seeking students are not eligible to enroll. More information at [http://www.nuhs.northwestern.edu/evanston/insurefaq.aspx](http://www.nuhs.northwestern.edu/evanston/insurefaq.aspx)

International students MUST purchase the NU health insurance.
